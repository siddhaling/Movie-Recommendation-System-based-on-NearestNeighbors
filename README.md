# MovieRecommenderSystem

This project was made by **Ankit Kapoor (2018A7PS0230U)** and **Arshiyan Ulde (2018A7PS0133U)**

A google doc file with the project code can be found **[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z1q6Oh120H23QrNxgsySyrqLpOPkwLUC/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117806499075101418555&rtpof=true&sd=true)**

This is a movie recommender system that works on the basis of the **KNN (K Nearest Neighbors)** algorithm. The database used has close to 10,000 movies and 110,000 user reviews which are all tabulated to generate a recommendation list for any given movie based on the given movie.

The entire code is written in just one executable python file, namely **recommendersystem.py**. The file takes no inputs, but outputs a list of 20 recommended movies based on the movie initially provided to the algorithm. The execution steps are as follows:

~~~python
python recommendersystem.py
(make sure that all files are in the same directory)
~~~

The movie database for this project was taken from **[here](https://github.com/Praful2000/YoutubeLectures/tree/master/Movie%20KNN)**

Contents of the repository:

* **recommendersystem.py** : Contains the working python code of the program
* **database.md** : A .md file which contains all the information about the database used for this project
* **helpdocument.md** : A .md file which contains information about all the dependencies and packages used for the code, and also shows how the code is executed
* **methods.md** : A .md file containing a detailed explanation regarding all the methods and techniques used in the code
* **results.md** : A .md file containing the various results from the program

**Included in all the .md files is a link to a google docs file with the same information available in a .docx format**
